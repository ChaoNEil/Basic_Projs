# Basic_Projs

Some basic projects/programs that i will make/made over the course of my programming journey. Also i am getting getting my hands wet with git and github. This is also for my practice.

1. Countdown Timer (Forloops practice) - 
      Its a timer thats counts in reverse :0

2. Encrypt/Decrypt program (some modules,loops,random) - 
      Shuffles every letter in the user provided message from a randomly generated pool of characters, also known as substitution cipher. It can also decrypt encrypted         messaged :)  
      
3. HexToBase64 -
      This function first converts the hexadecimal string to bytes using the bytes.fromhex() method. Then, it uses the base64.b64encode() method to encode the bytes as         base64, and finally decodes the result to a string using decode('utf-8').
